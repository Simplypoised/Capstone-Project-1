<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I have 31 years experience as an English/Language Arts instructional coach and teacher. Overall, I spent 35 years
  tutoring and teaching. Using instructional data, I administered needs assessments and examined an individual's
  standardized test results, performance assessments, and written and graphical products to assess areas of improvement.
  Next, I wrote descriptive plans of action with strategies to address the needs. Throughout my career, students,
  teachers, schools, and school districts benefited from my knowledge and skills. I left the learner with their own
  means of understanding text and strategies they take with them for life. I have many experiences in encouraging
  others to learn to their potential and a vast knowledge of what research-based strategies unlock meaning for children
  and adults. I taught English in grades 6 through 12, journalism, creative writing, and reading to students of all
  backgrounds and all levels. My most rewarding experiences came from teaching students who found learning quite
  challenging. I happen to have a unique ability to build protocols for learning based on needs.

<p>As I pivoted in my career to Computers and Information technology, I wanted to continue inspiring others to achieve
  in every endeavor. My education and need for knowledge have not stopped and never will. I received my A+ Certification
  in Information Technology Support and Computer Repair. I acquired CCNA, certification all while battling breast
  cancer.
  I enjoy learning and institute fun ways of doing it for myself and others. I want to survive, so I challenge myself
  at every level. I introduced others to technology and taught them the skills needed to access the World Wide Web.
  I am now ready to enjoy my creative side which includes writing but it takes money to totally enjoy what I do. I have
  a repertoire of pieces of writing I want to finish them and share my talents with others through my website.
